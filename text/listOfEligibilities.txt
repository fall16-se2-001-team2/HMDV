Veterans in Shelby County who are low-income and have anything other than a dishonorable discharge may be eligible, including veterans who are ex-offenders.  An individual could have served only one day in active military duty to be classified as a Veteran.

The priority is for eligible homeless Veteran families who are literally homeless (staying in a public or private place: car, park, abandoned building, bus station, or outdoors). Persons who are "literally homeless" lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. An additional focus is on homelessness prevention assistance for eligible Veteran families who are imminently at-risk of becoming homeless through losing their current primary nighttime residence (housing that is rented, housing shared with others, and rooms in hotels paid by the individual) due to eviction.
